In South Africa, there are two main types of invoices that are considered [valid by SARS](https://www.sars.gov.za/businesses-and-employers/government/tax-invoices/). These are full tax invoices and abridged invoices. In this guide, we will discuss the differences between these two types of invoices.

## Invoices vs Abridged Invoices

Full tax invoices are required for transactions with a value of R5000.00 or more (including VAT). Abridged invoices are permitted for transactions with a value greater than R50.00 and less than R5000.00 (including VAT).

### Full Tax Invoices

Full tax invoices are comprehensive documents that provide a detailed breakdown of a transaction between a buyer and a seller. These invoice are required to contain:

1. The words "Tax Invoice", "VAT Invoice" or "Invoice"
2. Name, address and VAT registration number of the supplier
3. Name, address and where the recipient is a vendor, the recipientâ€™s VAT registration number
4. Serial number and date of issue of invoice
5. Accurate description of goods and /or services (indicating where applicable that the goods are second hand goods)
6. Quantity or volume of goods or services supplied
7. Value of the supply, the amount of tax charged and the consideration of the supply (value and the tax)

### Abridged Invoices

Abridged invoices, on the other hand, are simplified versions of regular invoices. They are commonly used for transactions with lower values or for quick payment requests. Abridged invoices may contain less detailed information but still capture essential elements like:

1. The words "Tax Invoice", "VAT Invoice" or "Invoice"
2. Name, address and VAT registration number of the supplier
3. Serial number and date of issue of invoice
4. Accurate description of goods and /or services (indicating where applicable that the goods are second hand goods)
5. Value of the supply, the amount of tax charged and the consideration of the supply (value and the tax)
